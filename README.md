# lazarus

a simple python script that uses the Telegram Bot API to send messages to a specified group or user.

great for if/when you are kicked from a group, but your bot remains

Note: In this implementation, I have replaced my token and chatid with placeholders. If you would like to use this script, replace them with your own.
